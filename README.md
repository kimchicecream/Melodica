# Melodica

**Melodica** is an interactive rhythm game inspired by Guitar Hero, where players hit falling notes in sync with music tracks. Built with a modern full-stack setup, the game allows users to play, create, and share custom beat maps using their own music.

> ⚠️ Melodica is currently in its beta phase. Features and designs are subject to change as the game evolves.
